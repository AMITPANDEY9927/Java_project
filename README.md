# Tic-Tac-Toe GUI

## Description
This is a simple GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using `Swing` and `AWT` libraries. The game allows two players to take turns and play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their symbol (X or O) wins the game. If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Interactive 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O).
- Displays a message when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- Automatically resets the board after a game is won or drawn.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the `TicTacToeGUI.java` file using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac TicTacToeGUI.java
